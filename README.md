# riscv-cpu

A fully functional RISC-V compatible multicycle CPU built in Verilog.  
Implements a five-stage FSM controller, datapath, ALU, register file, and memory interface, with complete testbenches for simulation and verification.

##  Overview

The goal was to implement a simplified but realistic **RISC-V processor**, built incrementally from core components like the ALU and register file, up to a complete multicycle CPU architecture with instruction and data memory.


This project was developed as part of the **Low-Level Digital HW Systems I** course at the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (AUTH), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

##  Resources Used

- **Verilog HDL** – Hardware description and module design
- **Tools & Simulators** – EDA Playground & Icarus Verilog 12.0 
- **Instruction Set Architecture** - RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: Unprivileged ISA, Document Version 20191213

##  Features

###  Instruction Support
Implements core RISC-V instructions:
- **Register-Register:** `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `SLT`, `SLL`, `SRL`, `SRA`
- **Immediate:** `ADDI`, `ANDI`, `ORI`, `XORI`, `SLTI`, `SLLI`, `SRLI`, `SRAI`
- **Memory:** `LW`, `SW`
- **Branch:** `BEQ`

##  Simulation & Results

- **ALU and Calculator** are tested using a variety of input combinations.
- **FSM CPU Execution** is verified using an instruction ROM and RAM, observing program counter, memory addresses, and write-back data.
- Waveforms and output logs confirm correct instruction decoding, branching, and memory access.
- Results included in [`report.pdf`](./report.pdf).
