# riscv-cpu

A fully functional RISC-V compatible multicycle CPU built in Verilog.  
Implements a five-stage FSM controller, datapath, ALU, register file, and memory interface, with complete testbenches for simulation and verification.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal was to implement a simplified but realistic **RISC-V processor**, built incrementally from core components like the ALU and register file, up to a complete multicycle CPU architecture with instruction and data memory.


This project was developed as part of the **Low-Level Digital HW Systems I** course at the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (AUTH), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

## 🛠️ Resources Used

- **Verilog HDL** – Hardware description and module design
- **Tools & Simulators** – EDA Playground & Icarus Verilog 12.0 
- **Instruction Set Architecture** - RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: Unprivileged ISA, Document Version 20191213

## 🧪 Simulation & Results

- **ALU and Calculator** are tested using a variety of input combinations.
- **FSM CPU Execution** is verified using an instruction ROM and RAM, observing program counter, memory addresses, and write-back data.
- Waveforms and output logs confirm correct instruction decoding, branching, and memory access.
- Results included in [`report.pdf`](./report.pdf).
